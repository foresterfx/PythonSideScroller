# PythonSideScroller
A simple side scrolling adventure game.

## Installation
Run a python virtual environment then install pygame and run the program.
```python
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
python3 app.py
```

## Contributing
Feel free to do a pull request or make changes as you see fit. I probably did not implement this in the best way possible. It runs fine, but my computer is probably a little overkill for a simple python game.

The foundations of this game were from the tutorial series from Coding With Russ

I implemented my own changes and used sprites from random free assets sites. I lost their links, but you can reverse image search them to find their author (credit was not required)
